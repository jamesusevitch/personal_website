abstract: This article presents a novel method for a class of multirobot networks to resiliently propagate vector messages from a set of leaders to all followers within the network in the presence of faulty or adversarially behaving robots. It is shown that the proposed method can operate under heterogeneous communication rates between robots and perturbations of the leadersâ€™ propagated information. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to the problem of time-varying trajectory tracking; more specifically, time-varying reference trajectories in the form of Bezier curves are encoded into vectors of static parameters, which, in turn, are resiliently propagated from the leaders to the followers.
